SwiftTetris

The current version is incomplete, but you can still play with it.
the critical system such as falling, rotation, clear rows is ok but still needs improvement.

Things to improve:
Rotation: Despite the current rotation is working, but its far from good, in fact the code for handling rotation is pretty mess. the shape could be easliy 'blocked' by the edge of board, which is annoying.

Shape spwan position: when spawn new shape, the location is fixed for the current version, but it should be some random position right?

Interaction: If you read the code you can find that I tried to make the interaction via gesture recognizer, but I couldn't make it right, so I added 2 buttons instead.

Animation: there is no animation, I don't know if it's needed, but a animation should appear when clear rows happen.

many other to be add.....
